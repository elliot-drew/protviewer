# protviewer - Work in progress
3D protein visualisation for exploration of Uniprot annotations on PDB and SwissModel protein structures.

Idea is to create an easy and fast way for students to explore sequence annotations in a structural context. Search for a gene with a UniProt accession code, then select an experimental structure from the PDB.

### New! - will now fetch a model from the new Alphafold Database!

A variety of annotations can be displayed, more to be added.

Large degree of control over the viewer, including representations, colors, showing contacts within a range of a selected residue etc.

More to be added. 

Web based version is available [here](https://elliot-drew.github.io/protviewer/). Also being developed as an electron app, but executables not yet available - feel free to make your own.

If you have problems feel free to get in contact, although I can't guarantee I'll be able to respond/help in any reasonable amount of time.

# protviewer - Work in progress
3D protein visualisation for exploration of Uniprot annotations on PDB and SwissModel protein structures.

Idea is to create an easy and fast way for students to explore sequence annotations in a structural context. Search for a gene with a UniProt accession code, then select either an experimental structure from the PDB or a homology model from the SWISS-MODEL respository if available.

A variety of annotations can be displayed, more to be added.

Large degree of control over the viewer, including representations, colors, showing contacts etc.

More to be added, any suggestions welcomed.

Currently only available as a Windows 10 electron based executable. OSX and Linux versions to come. A web based version will be available once I bother to sort out web hosting.
